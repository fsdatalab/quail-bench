# QUAIL-B

QUAIL-B is a benchmark of AI filter and join queries over document
sets. This repository defines the benchmark and runs no engine: the
document sets (`quail_b/data.py`), the prompts (`quail_b/prompts.py`),
the queries as data (`quail_b/queries.py`), the saved reference labels
(`quail_b/labels.py`), the exact prompt text a predicate asks
(`quail_b/rendering.py`), the predicates and label identities
(`quail_b/predicates.py`),
and the scoring of one run (`quail_b/scoring.py`). An engine's runner
turns a `QuerySpec` into that engine's query and hands the answers back
as a `RunOutput` to score. Quail's runner lives in the Quail repository
under `quail/bench/`. The rules below are the Quail project's rules and
apply here unchanged.

# How to communicate in this project

Write every response simply, plainly, and clearly, like two human
engineers talking to each other at a whiteboard. No jargon.

- Use bullet points for any response longer than a few sentences.
- No analogies or metaphors, ever. Say the literal thing: "the
  experiment is running on Modal", not "the flight is in the air".
- No invented shorthand or dramatic phrasing ("banked", "landed",
  "armed", "healthy") when a plain verb exists: saved, finished,
  set up, running.
- Use everyday words. If a technical term is unavoidable, define it in
  one sentence the first time it appears, then use it consistently.
- Short sentences. One idea per sentence. Lead with the answer, then
  give the reasoning.
- Use numbers, and say in plain words what each number is compared
  with: "52.3 seconds, compared with the 47 seconds the hardware needs
  for the unavoidable work alone."
- When something failed or is uncertain, say so directly and say what
  would settle it.
- Code comments state constraints the code cannot show; nothing else.
- Docstrings follow Google style: one-line summary, blank line, then
  optional Args/Returns/Raises sections. Keep them short — say what
  the code does, not why it was written or what it replaced.
- Call the KV cache "KV". Do not rename it with analogies like "notes".
- Never say "arm" or "arms" for the runs of an experiment. Say
  "run", "configuration", or name the method being run.

# Style checks

CI runs these on every pull request. Run them before pushing:

    uv run ruff check quail_b tests tools
    uv run python tools/check_long_strings.py
    uv run vulture
    uv run pytest -q

- Ruff enforces line length 88, import order, naming, and Google style
  docstrings (`[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`). Missing docstrings
  are not yet flagged; that rule turns on once the backlog is written.
- `tools/check_long_strings.py` flags a string literal over 200
  characters, counted after the parser joins adjacent pieces, so a
  long string cannot hide by spanning lines. A long literal is allowed
  when it is clearly content: assigned to a name containing PROMPT,
  TEMPLATE, SQL, QUERY, HTML, or TEXT, kept in a prompts module or
  folder (any part of the path contains "prompt"), or plainly HTML or
  SQL. Docstrings are
  exempt. Long messages, log lines, and strings built inline in a call
  get shortened; long content gets named for what it is.

# Naming in this project

- The project is Quail (QUery-Aware Inference Layer). The package is
  `quail`. Nothing is called DocEngine any more.
- The three mechanisms are "pipelining", "token-based admission", and
  "KV rewind". Say those names.
- "Chain mode" is the internal name for KV rewind (one living request
  per document). Either is fine in code; prefer "KV rewind" in prose.
- The comparison is against "stock vLLM", and say which submission
  strategy it used: operator-at-a-time execution or pipelining.
- `de1|` in request ids is a wire-format version tag, not a product
  name. Leave it alone.

# Scope

Filter queries only, Qwen3 4B fp8 or Qwen3 32B fp8, one H100 per model
(one model copy per GPU - no tensor-parallel weight sharding across
GPUs). Open-ended maps, classification, speculation, and forking were
removed on purpose. Do not reintroduce them without being asked; if a
change needs one of them, say so instead of quietly adding it back.

# Experiments

- Nothing here needs a GPU or Modal. The labeling pass lives in
  Quail's repository (`quail/bench/labeling.py`, Modal wrapper
  `quail/bench/judge_pass.py`). The rules below about Modal apply to
  runs made from there.
- Never create new Modal app names; caches and warm state ride on
 the app. New GPU cells attach to an existing app
 ("quail-milestone1" for cells, "quail-engine" for the worker).
- Tee every Modal run to a file. The CLI drops old log lines.
- Do not write Modal return values to local JSON files. For a Modal
  Function, print the function call id (the `fc-...` Modal assigns to
  one invocation) and keep that id in the tee file. When you need the
  result, pull it with `modal.FunctionCall.from_id("<id>").get()`.
  An Arrow Flight server request has no Modal function call id. Print
  the Flight query id and the result volume path instead.
- Experiment data lives on the `quail-results` Modal volume, summaries
  as well as per-item records. Do not commit it. Reports cite it by
  volume path: `/results/ablations/<file>.json`.
- A plot script reads its numbers from the volume. Take the workdir
  holding the pulled files as its first argument, and put the
  `modal volume get` commands in its docstring so the figure can be
  rebuilt from the report alone. Derive percentages, ratios and other
  computed values in the script rather than storing them.
- State the prediction before the run, then report what happened
  against it.
- Compute from measured constants first; run one confirming cell, not
  a sweep, unless the sweep is the point.
- A baseline must be configured as well as the thing it is compared
  with. If our side gets a plan-derived setting, the baseline gets the
  analytically equivalent one. Report the setting alongside the
  result.
- Report query time, throughput, and GPU cost for every benchmark
  query. Use the following definitions consistently:
  - For a filter-only query, `documents/second` is the number of input
    document rows divided by query runtime in seconds.
  - For a query with joins, `document pairs/second` is the number of
    evaluated document pairs, summed across all join stages, divided
    by query runtime in seconds.
  - `$/query` is query runtime in hours multiplied by the number of
    GPUs and the H100! hourly price. Use
    `quail.specs.H100_USD_PER_HOUR`, which is currently
    $3.9492 from https://modal.com/pricing.
  - The primary `$/query` number excludes model startup, just as the
    primary query time does. If startup cost is useful, report it as a
    separate clearly labeled number.

# Reports

Experiment reports live under `reports/`. Do not add shipped-feature reports
to this repository.

- Every PR that includes an experiment must produce a report in
  `reports/`. Name the file `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md`.
  The report states the setup, the prediction, the measured result,
  and what the numbers mean. Cite the data by its `quail-results`
  volume path.
- When a report is superseded or its numbers are no longer current,
  delete the report, its plot script, and its PNGs from
  `reports/plots/`. Before starting a new task, scan `reports/`
  for outdated reports, orphaned plot scripts, and PNGs not
  referenced by any current report, and delete them all.
- `reports/engine-wiki.md` is a living reference doc, not a
  per-PR report. Update it in place when the engine's design changes.

# Issues and PR descriptions

Include a figure whenever one carries the point better than text:

- For measured numbers, embed the report's committed plot. Link the
  image by its raw GitHub URL pinned to a commit
  (`.../raw/<sha>/reports/plots/<name>.png`) so it keeps
  rendering as the branch moves. Do not make new plots just for an
  issue or PR body; reuse the report's.
- For a design, plan, or dataflow change, include a mermaid diagram
  of the structure (GitHub renders ```mermaid blocks).

# Plots

Every report with measured results should include at least one plot.

## QUAIL-B plot standard

- Maintain one main plot covering all queries and one plot per dataset.
  Include every query in its dataset plot. Do not create a separate FEV-9
  figure or another standalone query figure for the benchmark comparison.
- Generate the full set with `reports/make_quailb_comparison_plots.py`.
  Save vector PDFs as `reports/plots/quailb_main.pdf` and
  `quailb_<dataset>.pdf`. Use grouped bars for the main comparison.
  Use readable page sizes and split metrics across pages instead of
  shrinking all metrics into one wide figure. Keep text as embedded fonts
  and marks as vectors. PNGs may be first-page previews for Markdown;
  link the PDF as the primary artifact and never embed a PNG inside it.
  Keep method order, colors, and metric definitions consistent across them.
- Show the SoL estimate as a horizontal line across each query's bar group
  in latency and token plots. Reserve bars for measured configurations.
  SoL models ideal computation and memory traffic, with prefix KV reused across requests,
  documents, and repeated aliases wherever their token prefixes match.
  Use the distinct-prefix estimate, not the per-document-only estimate.
  State its retained-KV capacity and survivor assumptions. Identify it as
  an estimate, not a measured backend, and do not invent accuracy for it.
  Validate query definitions and corpus identity before reusing estimates.
  Recalculate stale estimates on the CPU from saved inputs without inference.
- Show these metrics for each query and configuration:
  - Latency in seconds, excluding model startup and result collection.
  - Total recomputed KV tokens across the query (`regret_tokens`). These
    count reusable document or anchor prefix tokens computed again because
    their KV was unavailable. Use the existing per-document accounting;
    do not silently substitute the distinct-prefix metric.
  - Total fresh input tokens computed across the query (`fresh_tokens`).
    A fresh token is an input token position processed by a model forward
    pass instead of read from existing KV. Count repeated computation again.
    This includes new document and prompt-suffix tokens and recomputed
    prefix tokens. It is not a count of unique text or generated answers.
    Recomputed KV tokens are included in fresh tokens, not added to them.
  - Accuracy as agreement with the saved reference labels on evaluated
    predicate answers. Name the reference model. Include final output
    precision and recall in the report so false positive joins are visible.
  - Input document count for each relation or set, before filters. List
    every alias separately, including repeated uses of the same set.
    Put counts beside query labels or on a readable table page in the PDF. Label
    any survivor counts separately from input counts.
- Keep throughput and GPU cost in the report tables using the definitions
  above. Derive totals, percentages, and ratios from saved volume results.
- Reuse existing results when updating figures unless a rerun is requested.
  State the source run for updated measurements. If a query definition
  changed, omit incompatible old measurements and label missing baselines.
  Do not compare different query definitions or display missing values as zero.
- When replacing the plot layout, remove obsolete figures and their scripts,
  and update all report references. A benchmark change should update the
  main plot and its dataset plot together.

## Where plotting code lives

- One script per report (or per group of related reports), named
  `make_<slug>_plots.py`, in `reports/`.
- Output figures go to `reports/plots/`. Delete a report's figures when
  the report is deleted.
- Reference plots in the report by relative path:
  `"Figure: plots/<name>.png"`.
- Each script should be runnable from the repository root, given a
  workdir holding the files pulled off the volume:
  `uv run --with matplotlib python reports/make_<slug>_plots.py $W`.
- The PNGs are committed; the numbers behind them are not. That is
  what lets a PR body embed a figure by raw GitHub URL.

## Style

Use `reports/quail.mplstyle` in every plotting script:

    plt.style.use(Path(__file__).parent / "quail.mplstyle")

Import colors from `reports/plot_colors.py`:

    from plot_colors import BLUE, GRAY, GREEN, RED, DARK, ORANGE, TEAL

### Principles

These follow Tufte's data-ink ratio and Heer's encoding
effectiveness research:

- Every mark encodes data. No background fills, no 3D effects, no
  decorative gridlines.
- Label data directly on or next to bars/points. Use a legend only
  when direct labels would overlap or repeat.
- In profiling plots, use the original function or operation names from
  the trace, such as `vllm.scheduler.schedule` or `scheduler.run_batch`.
  Do not replace them with descriptive labels.
- State the unit on every axis, and make the axis label the unit and
  nothing else: "microseconds per fresh token", not "wall
  microseconds per fresh token (IMDB-7, profiled run)". Context
  beyond the unit belongs in the title.
- Every plot has a title. When the plot shows one benchmark query,
  the title names the query identifier (for example "IMDB-7"); with
  one panel per query, each panel's title names its query.
- With subplots, leave enough space between panels that labels and
  annotations never crowd the neighboring panel. Keep labels
  consistent across panels, and never repeat in a bar or tick label
  what the title already says (if the title says the attention path,
  the labels do not).
- When comparing two things, put them next to each other on the same
  axis so the reader's eye measures the gap, not their memory.
- Annotate the delta (speedup, difference) inline near the data it
  describes.
- Use color to distinguish categories, not to decorate. Two
  categories need two colors, not five.
- Use a log scale only when the data spans more than one order of
  magnitude. Say so in the axis label.
- Use vector PDFs for QUAIL-B, with 300 DPI PNG previews. Other report
  figures use 300 DPI PNG files. No SVG.
- Make the canvas large enough that text and data marks remain sharp when
  viewed on GitHub.
