# QUAIL-B

QUAIL-B is an academic benchmark of 33 AI SQL queries over document tables. AI SQL is SQL with LLM-powered operators.

This repository publishes the query plans, input relations, reference labels, and scoring harness. It does not include an execution engine. An engine connects through an adapter function that translates each query plan into the engine's AI SQL dialect and returns the execution results.

## Scale Factors

QUAIL-B defines three scale factors: `0.1`, `0.5`, and `1.0`. They correspond to 10%, 50%, and 100% of each dataset's sampling target.

A scale factor changes the input table cardinalities and reference labels. It does not change the 33 query definitions.

| Dataset | Relation | 0.1 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| IMDB | `reviews` | 5,000 | 25,000 | 50,000 |
| IMDB | `aspects` | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| BioDEX | `reports` | 500 | 2,500 | 5,000 |
| BioDEX | `terms` | 1,127 | 2,934 | 4,144 |
| FEVER | `claims` | 500 | 2,500 | 5,000 |
| FEVER | `evidence` | 287 | 1,037 | 1,478 |
| LePaRD | `citation_contexts` | 500 | 2,496 | 4,972 |
| LePaRD | `citation_passages` | 433 | 1,756 | 2,991 |
| SWE-Next | `agent_traces` | 1,772 | 8,859 | 17,711 |

Each scale factor deterministically samples upstream snapshots defined in [`quail_b/data.py`](quail_b/data.py).

## Queries

The benchmark evaluates 33 queries across 5 datasets:

| Dataset | Queries | Relations | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| IMDB | 10 | `reviews`, `aspects` | Movie review aspect extraction and sentiment analysis |
| BioDEX | 3 | `reports`, `terms` | Adverse drug reaction reporting from medical papers |
| FEVER | 10 | `claims`, `evidence` | Fact verification with two-sided selections and join chains |
| LePaRD | 8 | `citation_contexts`, `citation_passages` | Legal precedent retrieval and citation matching |
| SWE-Next | 2 | `agent_traces` | Software engineering agent trajectory evaluation |

Queries use two LLM-powered relational operators:

- `ai_filter(prompt, document) -> boolean` (selection)
- `ai_join(prompt, left, right) -> boolean` (join)

All 33 queries are stored as standard Substrait 0.103 ProtoJSON plans in [`quail_b/plans/`](quail_b/plans/). Custom AI functions are declared in [`quail_b/substrait_extensions.yaml`](quail_b/substrait_extensions.yaml). [All 33 plans](figures/quailb_anatomy.pdf) are diagrammed in one figure.

### Example Query: IMDB-4

IMDB-4 applies two selection filters to movie reviews, followed by a join against movie aspects:

```sql
SELECT r.id, a.id
FROM reviews AS r
AI JOIN aspects AS a ON J1(r.body, a.aspect)
WHERE AI_FILTER(F1, r.body)
  AND AI_FILTER(F4, r.body);
```

Its relational operator tree is:

```text
Project [r.id, a.id]
└── AI Join J1                                      join-1
    ├── AI Selection F4                             filter-2
    │   └── AI Selection F1                         filter-1
    │       └── Scan reviews AS r
    └── Scan aspects AS a
```

In the Substrait plan, `F1`, `F4`, and `J1` are string prompt literals. Exact prompt texts and rendering logic are defined in [`quail_b/prompts.py`](quail_b/prompts.py) and [`quail_b/rendering.py`](quail_b/rendering.py).

## How to Adapt an Engine

An engine connects through an adapter function:

```python
run_query(query: quail_b.QuerySpec, tables: dict[str, pyarrow.Table]) -> quail_b.RunOutput
```

The adapter receives:
- `query`: A `QuerySpec` instance. Its `query.plan` property provides the parsed Substrait `Plan`.
- `tables`: A dictionary mapping relation names to input PyArrow tables.

The adapter translates the Substrait plan into the target engine's AI SQL dialect (for example BigQuery AI SQL, Lotus, Palimpzest, or DuckDB), executes it, and returns a `RunOutput`.

### The `RunOutput` Contract

Required fields:
- `rows`: A `pyarrow.Table` containing final output tuples, with one ID column per selected alias (such as `r` and `a`).
- `runtime_s`: Query execution time in seconds as a float. This excludes engine startup and model loading.

Optional fields (used for predicate accuracy and token accounting):
- `filter_answers`: A dictionary mapping filter operator ID (such as `"filter-1"`) to a `pyarrow.Table` of evaluated document IDs and boolean `answer` values.
- `join_answers`: A dictionary mapping join operator ID (such as `"join-1"`) to a `pyarrow.Table` of evaluated left/right ID pairs and boolean `answer` values.
- `measurements`: A dictionary for engine telemetry. Reporting `measurements["fresh_tokens"]` records the count of input tokens processed in model forward passes.
- `prompt_pieces`: Tokenized prompt IDs for prefix KV accounting.

If an engine does not record individual predicate answers, pass `filter_answers=None` and `join_answers=None`.

### Concrete Adapter Example

```python
import pyarrow as pa
import quail_b


def run_query(query: quail_b.QuerySpec, tables: dict[str, pa.Table]) -> quail_b.RunOutput:
    sql = to_engine_sql(query.plan)
    result = execute(sql, tables)

    return quail_b.RunOutput(
        rows=pa.table({
            "r": result.output_review_ids,
            "a": result.output_aspect_ids,
        }),
        runtime_s=result.query_seconds,
        filter_answers={
            "filter-1": pa.table({"r": result.f1_ids, "answer": result.f1_answers}),
            "filter-2": pa.table({"r": result.f4_ids, "answer": result.f4_answers}),
        },
        join_answers={
            "join-1": pa.table({
                "r": result.join_review_ids,
                "a": result.join_aspect_ids,
                "answer": result.join_answers,
            }),
        },
        measurements={"fresh_tokens": result.fresh_tokens},
        prompt_pieces=result.prompt_pieces,
    )
```

## Installation

QUAIL-B requires Python 3.12.

```sh
uv add "quail-b @ git+https://github.com/fsdatalab/quail-bench.git"
```

For development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fsdatalab/quail-bench.git
cd quail-bench
uv sync
```

## Running the Benchmark

Run queries using `quail_b.run`:

```python
import quail_b

quail_b.run(
    run_query,
    queries=["IMDB-4"],
    scale_factor=0.1,
    output_dir="results/my-run",
    metadata={"engine": "my-engine", "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-FP8"},
    gpu_count=1,
    gpu_hourly_rate_usd=3.9492,
)
```

Omit `queries=` to run all 33 queries. Benchmark data is downloaded from `s3://quail-bench` and cached locally in `~/.cache/quail-b`.

### Inspecting Data and Queries Directly

Inspect benchmark queries and load input tables directly without running the benchmark harness:

```python
import quail_b

query = quail_b.get_query("IMDB-4")
plan = query.plan

reviews = quail_b.load_table("reviews", scale_factor=0.1)
```

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Query time / latency | Query execution time in seconds (`runtime_s`). Excludes engine startup. |
| Filter throughput | Input documents processed per second (`documents/second`). |
| Join throughput | Evaluated document pairs per second (`document pairs/second`). |
| GPU cost | Query cost in dollars (`$/query`), calculated as execution hours × GPU count × hourly price. |
| Predicate accuracy | Agreement with reference labels on evaluated filter and join answers. |
| Output precision & recall | Precision and recall of final output rows compared to reference result rows. |
| Fresh tokens | Input token positions processed by model forward passes. |
| Minimum tokens | Distinct input token positions required under an unlimited KV prefix cache. |
| Recomputed KV tokens | Fresh tokens minus minimum tokens (`regret_tokens`). Measures redundant KV computation. |

Reference labels are generated using `Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8`. FEVER and LePaRD also evaluate against published dataset ground truth.

## Results and CLI

Each benchmark run writes results to a structured directory:

```text
results/my-run/
├── run.json
├── report.md
├── measurements.parquet
└── IMDB-4/
    ├── plan.substrait
    ├── rows.parquet
    ├── filters-0.parquet
    ├── filters-1.parquet
    ├── joins-0.parquet
    └── prompt_pieces.json
```

- `run.json`: Complete execution record with parameters, configuration metadata, and per-query metrics.
- `report.md`: Markdown summary table with execution times, throughput, accuracy, and token counts.
- `measurements.parquet`: Parquet table containing one row of metrics per completed query.
- Per-query directories: Serialized Substrait plans, output rows, predicate answer tables, and token piece definitions.

Rebuild or rescore a report from saved results:

```sh
quail-b report results/my-run
```
