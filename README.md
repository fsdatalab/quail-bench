# QUAIL-B

QUAIL-B is an academic benchmark of 30 AI SQL queries over document tables. AI SQL is SQL with LLM-powered operators.

This repository publishes the query plans, input tables, reference labels, and scoring harness. It does not include an execution engine. To benchmark your engine, you write an adapter function that translates each Substrait query plan into your engine's AI SQL dialect, executes it, and returns the execution results to QUAIL-B for scoring.

## Installation

QUAIL-B requires Python 3.12.

```sh
uv add "quail-b @ git+https://github.com/fsdatalab/quail-bench.git"
```

For development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fsdatalab/quail-bench.git
cd quail-bench
uv sync
```

## How to Adapt Your Engine

To run QUAIL-B against your query engine, you write an adapter function:

```python
run_query(query: quail_b.QuerySpec, tables: dict[str, pyarrow.Table]) -> quail_b.RunOutput
```

Your adapter receives:
- `query`: A `QuerySpec` instance. Its `query.plan` property provides the parsed Substrait 0.103 `Plan`.
- `tables`: A dictionary mapping table names to input PyArrow tables.

You translate the Substrait plan into your engine's AI SQL dialect (for example, [BigQuery AI SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/generative-ai-overview)), execute it, and return a `RunOutput`.

### The `RunOutput` Contract

Required fields:
- `rows`: A `pyarrow.Table` containing final output tuples, with one ID column per selected alias (such as `r` and `a`).
- `runtime_s`: Query execution time in seconds as a float. This excludes engine startup and model loading.

Optional fields (used for predicate accuracy and token accounting):
- `filter_answers`: A dictionary mapping filter operator ID (such as `"filter-1"`) to a `pyarrow.Table` of evaluated document IDs and boolean `answer` values.
- `join_answers`: A dictionary mapping join operator ID (such as `"join-1"`) to a `pyarrow.Table` of evaluated left/right ID pairs and boolean `answer` values.
- `measurements`: A dictionary for engine telemetry. Reporting `measurements["fresh_tokens"]` records the count of input tokens processed in model forward passes.
- `prompt_pieces`: Tokenized prompt IDs for prefix KV accounting.

If your engine does not record individual predicate answers, pass `filter_answers=None` and `join_answers=None`.

### Concrete Adapter Example

For query `IMDB-4` (see [Queries](#queries) below), your adapter translates the plan, executes the query against `tables["reviews"]` and `tables["aspects"]`, and returns the results:

```python
import pyarrow as pa
import quail_b


def run_query(query: quail_b.QuerySpec, tables: dict[str, pa.Table]) -> quail_b.RunOutput:
    sql = to_engine_sql(query.plan)
    result = execute(sql, tables)

    return quail_b.RunOutput(
        rows=pa.table({
            "r": result.output_review_ids,
            "a": result.output_aspect_ids,
        }),
        runtime_s=result.query_seconds,
        filter_answers={
            "filter-1": pa.table({"r": result.f1_ids, "answer": result.f1_answers}),
            "filter-2": pa.table({"r": result.f4_ids, "answer": result.f4_answers}),
        },
        join_answers={
            "join-1": pa.table({
                "r": result.join_review_ids,
                "a": result.join_aspect_ids,
                "answer": result.join_answers,
            }),
        },
        measurements={"fresh_tokens": result.fresh_tokens},
        prompt_pieces=result.prompt_pieces,
    )
```

`to_engine_sql` and `execute` are supplied by your adapter.

## Running the Benchmark

Pass your adapter function to `quail_b.run`:

```python
import quail_b

quail_b.run(
    run_query,
    queries=["IMDB-4"],  # Omit to run all 30 queries
    scale_factor=0.1,
    output_dir="results/my-run",  # Set your desired output directory path
    metadata={"engine": "my-engine", "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-FP8"},
    gpu_count=1,
    gpu_hourly_rate_usd=3.9492,
)
```

- `output_dir`: Path to the directory where QUAIL-B writes run results (e.g. `"results/vllm-qwen3-4b"` or any custom path). Must be a new directory.
- `queries`: List of query IDs to run. Omit `queries=` (or pass `None`) to run all 30 benchmark queries.
- Data is downloaded from `s3://quail-bench` and cached locally in `~/.cache/quail-b`.
- Only the reference labels of the selected queries' predicates are loaded, as Arrow tables of about 25 bytes per answer. Loading all 21 label sets at scale 0.1 (1.21 million answers) takes 1.9 s from cached files with a peak of 0.62 GiB, corpus tables included; at scale 1.0 (51.8 million answers) budget about 3 GiB.

### Inspecting Data and Queries Directly

Inspect benchmark queries and load input tables directly without running the benchmark harness:

```python
import quail_b

query = quail_b.get_query("IMDB-4")
plan = query.plan

reviews = quail_b.load_table("reviews", scale_factor=0.1)
```

## Queries

The benchmark evaluates 30 queries across 5 datasets:

| Dataset | Queries | Relations | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| IMDB | 10 | `reviews`, `aspects` | Movie review aspect extraction and sentiment analysis |
| BioDEX | 3 | `reports`, `terms` | Adverse drug reaction reporting from medical papers |
| FEVER | 10 | `claims`, `evidence` | Fact verification with two-sided selections and join chains |
| LePaRD | 5 | `citation_contexts`, `citation_passages` | Legal precedent retrieval and citation matching |
| SWE-Next | 2 | `agent_traces` | Software engineering agent trajectory evaluation |

LePaRD has five queries. The previous LEP-5, LEP-6, and LEP-8 were removed
because their reference filters leave no rows at sf=0.1. The previous LEP-7
is now LEP-5; its plan and prompts are unchanged. Historical results must
be matched by query definition, not by query ID alone.

BIO-1 selects reports describing a serious or life-threatening adverse event.
BIO-3 applies that filter before joining reports to reaction terms.

Queries use two LLM-powered relational operators:

- `ai_filter(prompt, document) -> boolean` (selection)
- `ai_join(prompt, left, right) -> boolean` (join)

All 30 queries are stored as standard Substrait 0.103 ProtoJSON plans in [`quail_b/plans/`](quail_b/plans/). Custom AI functions are declared in [`quail_b/substrait_extensions.yaml`](quail_b/substrait_extensions.yaml). [All 30 plans](figures/quailb_anatomy.pdf) are diagrammed in one figure.

### Example Query: IMDB-4

IMDB-4 applies two selection filters to movie reviews, followed by a join against movie aspects:

```sql
SELECT r.id, a.id
FROM reviews AS r
AI JOIN aspects AS a ON J1(r.body, a.aspect)
WHERE AI_FILTER(F1, r.body)
  AND AI_FILTER(F4, r.body);
```

Its relational operator tree is:

```text
Project [r.id, a.id]
└── AI Join J1                                      join-1
    ├── AI Selection F4                             filter-2
    │   └── AI Selection F1                         filter-1
    │       └── Scan reviews AS r
    └── Scan aspects AS a
```

In the Substrait plan, `F1`, `F4`, and `J1` are string prompt literals. Exact prompt texts and rendering logic are defined in [`quail_b/prompts.py`](quail_b/prompts.py) and [`quail_b/rendering.py`](quail_b/rendering.py).

Every filter and join instruction starts with "You are performing a data
processing task." The instruction follows the document, so the document's
KV can be reused across questions. The predicate version includes this
instruction.

## Scale Factors

QUAIL-B defines three scale factors: `0.1`, `0.5`, and `1.0`. They correspond to 10%, 50%, and 100% of each dataset's sampling target.

A scale factor changes the input table cardinalities and reference labels. It does not change the 30 query definitions.

| Dataset | Relation | 0.1 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| IMDB | `reviews` | 5,000 | 25,000 | 50,000 |
| IMDB | `aspects` | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| BioDEX | `reports` | 500 | 2,500 | 5,000 |
| BioDEX | `terms` | 1,127 | 2,934 | 4,144 |
| FEVER | `claims` | 500 | 2,500 | 5,000 |
| FEVER | `evidence` | 287 | 1,037 | 1,478 |
| LePaRD | `citation_contexts` | 500 | 2,496 | 4,972 |
| LePaRD | `citation_passages` | 433 | 1,756 | 2,991 |
| SWE-Next | `agent_traces` | 1,772 | 8,859 | 17,711 |

Each scale factor deterministically samples upstream snapshots defined in [`quail_b/data.py`](quail_b/data.py).

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Query time / latency | Query execution time in seconds (`runtime_s`). Excludes engine startup. |
| Filter throughput | Input documents processed per second (`documents/second`). |
| Join throughput | Evaluated document pairs per second (`document pairs/second`). |
| GPU cost | Query cost in dollars (`$/query`), calculated as execution hours × GPU count × hourly price. |
| Predicate accuracy | Agreement with reference labels on evaluated filter and join answers. |
| Output precision & recall | Precision and recall of final output rows compared to reference result rows. |
| Fresh tokens | Input token positions processed by model forward passes. |
| Input tokens | Full input lengths summed across evaluated prompts, including tokens served from KV. Each evaluated prompt counts its complete input once. Output tokens and repeated computation within a prompt are excluded. |
| Input token throughput | Input tokens divided by query execution time (`input_tokens_per_second`), excluding model startup and result collection. |
| Minimum tokens | Input token positions required under an unlimited KV prefix cache: each distinct prefix of the document requests once (a document's questions and frames share their common lead), and each pair's label, partner document, and answer cue once per pair. |
| Recomputed KV tokens | Fresh tokens minus minimum tokens (`regret_tokens`). Measures redundant KV computation. Tokens that must be computed once per request, such as a pair's suffix, are never regret. |

Input token throughput counts the prompts each method evaluated. Different filter
answers or plans can change those prompts and their total input length. It does not
measure how many token positions the GPU computed. If prompt pieces or an answer
table are missing, the input token count is unknown. If query time is zero,
input token throughput is unknown.

Reference labels are generated using `Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8`. FEVER and LePaRD also evaluate against published dataset ground truth.

## Results and CLI

Each benchmark run writes results to your configured `output_dir` (one subdirectory per evaluated query):

```text
results/my-run/
├── run.json
├── report.md
├── measurements.parquet
├── IMDB-1/
├── IMDB-2/
├── ...
└── IMDB-4/
    ├── plan.substrait
    ├── rows.parquet
    ├── filters-0.parquet
    ├── filters-1.parquet
    ├── joins-0.parquet
    └── prompt_pieces.json
```

- `run.json`: Complete execution record with parameters, configuration metadata, and per-query metrics.
- `report.md`: Markdown summary table with execution times, throughput, accuracy, and token counts.
- `measurements.parquet`: Parquet table containing one row of metrics per completed query.
- Per-query directories: Serialized Substrait plans, output rows, predicate answer tables, and token piece definitions.

Rebuild or rescore a report from saved results:

```sh
quail-b report results/my-run
```
